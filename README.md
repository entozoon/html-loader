# html-loader-entozoon

A bastardisation of the typical webpack [html-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-loader),

Featuring prop concept from [html-includes](https://github.com/entozoon/html-includes)

## Further dev?

Don't bother. This code is spaghetti nonsense for quick prototype purposes, seeing as the original html-loader@next is being entirely re-written, this will be obsolete soon enough - and I'll have to re-create this again, no doubt haha, but isn't stable enough to do so yet, at time of writing.

MOREOVER, [handlebars-loader](https://github.com/pcardune/handlebars-loader) is way better and does everything this did, lololz
